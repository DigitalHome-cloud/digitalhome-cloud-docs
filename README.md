# DigitalHome Cloud – Documentation Hub

The **DigitalHome Cloud Documentation Repository** is the central knowledge base for the entire DigitalHome.Cloud platform.  
It contains all cross-cutting architectural decisions, environment definitions, development guidelines, and platform-wide specifications that apply across all DHC applications and services.

This repository is **the canonical source of truth** for:

- Platform architecture  
- Release and environment strategy (alpha → beta → stage → prod)  
...

The documentation here applies to all DHC repositories, including:

- `digitalhome-cloud-portal`
